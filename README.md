For tic-tac-toe, a simple upper bound for the size of the state space is 3**9 = 19,683. (There are three states for each cell and nine cells.) This count includes many illegal positions, such as a position with five crosses and no noughts, or a position in which both players have a row of three. A more careful count, removing these illegal positions, gives 5,478.[2][3] And when rotations and reflections of positions are considered identical, there are only 765 essentially different positions.
